Screenshot: http://imgur.com/hAJOEYA

## Setup
1. Copy 'roku.html' to a server on your home network.
2. Replace all instances of 'YOURIPHERE' with your Roku's IP address. You may want to log in to your home router and assign a static IP address to your Roku s that you will not have to change this in the future.
3. Open 'roku.html' on a web browser and enjoy.

## Additional Information and Notes
* More about Roku here: https://www.roku.com
* API Docs: http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/External+Control+Guide
* I am not affiliated with roku.

## Tasks
* Use an IP variable instead of hard-coding the IP 50 times.
* Use API text search functionality (would be great on mobile w/ Swype).
* Link to common Apps
* Move the css to a separate file
